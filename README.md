### Hi there 👋

My name is Marcin. I am a FrontEnd developer who likes to explore the backend world. I love learning new things.


- 🔭 I am currently working on broadening my knowledge of online security (web development), exploring the backend world using node.js and graphql, and improving the structure in react-based projects.

- 🤔 Side projects: 
   -- Platfrom to share dev knowladge: Front: Vue.js (nuxt) and second similar in React, Apollo (GraphQL), Backend: Express.js, GraphQL, mongoDB
   -- Dji Tello drone control app with face recognition and service to ensure drone behavior in response to human emotions - creating project structure.
